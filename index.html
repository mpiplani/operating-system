 Introduction to Operating Systems is a graduate-level introductory course in operating systems.
 This course teaches the basic operating system abstractions, mechanisms, and their implementations.
 The core of the course contains concurrent programming (threads and synchronization), 
 inter process communication, and an introduction to distributed operating systems. 
 The course is split into four sections: <br>(1) Introduction, <br>(2) 
 Process and Thread Management, <br>(3) Resource Management and Communication,<br>(4) 
 Distributed Systems.<br><br>
 This class introduces the basic facilities provided in modern operating systems. The course divides into three major sections. The first part of the course discusses concurrency: how to manage multiple tasks that execute at the same time and share resources. Topics in this section include processes and threads, context switching, synchronization, scheduling, and deadlock. The second part of the course addresses the problem of memory management; it will cover topics such as linking, dynamic memory allocation, dynamic address translation, virtual memory, and demand paging. The third major part of the course concerns file systems, including topics such as storage devices, disk management and scheduling, directories, protection, and crash recovery. After these three major topics, the class will conclude with a few smaller topics such as virtual machines.
The class work consists of one problem set and a series of four programming projects based on the Pintos kernel. You will learn a lot from these projects, but be prepared to spend a significant amount of time working on them.
